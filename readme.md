## ✅ **What this repository contains**

✔️ **Topic-wise codes** following my structured DSA learning path
✔️ **Sorting and recursion algorithms** with clean implementation
✔️ **Competitive programming problems** solved and organised for revision
✔️ **STL practice codes** for quick review during contests

---

## ⚡ **How to use**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberknight-cmd/cpp-dsa.git
```

2. Open in VSCode for topic-wise navigation and quick execution.

---

## 🛑 **Note on build files**

This repo uses a `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts like:

* `.exe` files generated on compilation
* Temporary build data

Always **compile locally** using your preferred compiler setup before running codes.

---

## 🎯 **Goals**

* [x] Complete Sorting algorithms implementation
* [x] Learn recursion tree analysis
* [ ] Solve 50+ array problems
* [ ] Begin linked lists and trees
* [ ] Start advanced STL container practice

---

## ✨ **Why this repository exists**

This repository serves as:

* My **personal DSA preparation archive**
* A quick reference during contests
* Proof of structured learning and problem-solving approach
